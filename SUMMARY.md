# Project Summary: Migrating from `refine-pocketbase` to the PocketBase JS SDK

This document summarizes the process of migrating the Refine application from using the community-provided `refine-pocketbase` package to a custom implementation using the official PocketBase JS SDK directly. It also covers the troubleshooting steps taken to resolve issues encountered along the way.

## 1. Initial Goal

The primary objective was to remove the dependency on the `refine-pocketbase` community package and replace its functionality with a custom-built solution. This involved two main goals:

1.  **Direct SDK Integration:** Implement a new data provider, live provider, and auth provider using the `pocketbase` JS SDK.
2.  **Enable Real-Time:** Ensure that real-time updates were functional in the application.

## 2. Implementation Steps

1.  **Code Analysis:** The project was analyzed to understand the existing integration. `package.json` confirmed the use of `refine-pocketbase`, and `src/App.tsx` showed how the providers were initialized and passed to the `<Refine>` component.

2.  **Provider Scaffolding:** A new `src/utils` directory was created to house the custom provider implementations.

3.  **Custom Providers:** Three new files were created:
    *   `src/utils/dataProvider.ts`: To handle all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    *   `src/utils/liveProvider.ts`: To manage real-time subscriptions with PocketBase.
    *   `src/utils/authProvider.ts`: To handle user authentication (login, logout, session checking).

4.  **Integration:** `src/App.tsx` was updated to import and use these new, custom-built providers.

5.  **Dependency Removal:** The `refine-pocketbase` package was uninstalled from the project.

## 3. Problems Encountered and Solutions

### Problem 1: Deployment Failure

*   **Symptom:** The first deployment on Coolify after the code changes failed.
*   **Investigation:** The application's build command (`npm run build`) was run locally, which revealed multiple TypeScript errors in the newly created provider files.
*   **Solution:** The TypeScript errors were resolved through several iterations:
    1.  **Type-Only Imports:** Changed imports for `AuthProvider`, `DataProvider`, and `LiveProvider` to be type-only (`import type ...`) to comply with the project's `verbatimModuleSyntax` TypeScript setting.
    2.  **Generic Type Mismatches:** The data provider methods were returning types that didn't perfectly match the generic types expected by Refine's `DataProvider` interface. This was fixed by casting the data returned from PocketBase to `unknown` first, and then to the required generic type (e.g., `items as unknown as TData[]`).
    3.  **Incorrect Function Calls:** Fixed an incorrect call to the `unsubscribe` method in the `liveProvider`.

After these fixes, the application built successfully, and the Coolify deployment succeeded.

### Problem 2: Live Updates Not Working

*   **Symptom:** After a successful deployment, real-time updates were not functioning. The browser console showed a `ClientResponseError 0: Something went wrong` error, caused by an `EventSource connect took too long` timeout.
*   **Investigation:**
    1.  **Server Check:** We confirmed the PocketBase server was running and accessible by successfully loading the admin UI at `https://pocketbase.flowmatica.ca/_/`.
    2.  **Real-Time Endpoint Check:** We confirmed the real-time endpoint was working by navigating to `https://pocketbase.flowmatica.ca/api/realtime`, which established a successful, long-lived connection.
    3.  **Conclusion:** Since the server and its real-time endpoint were working correctly, the issue was isolated to the client-side code's attempt to connect.
*   **Current Action:** To diagnose the issue further, `console.log` statements have been added to the `liveProvider` to provide more insight into the subscription process. The next step is to analyze the browser console output after the latest redeployment.
